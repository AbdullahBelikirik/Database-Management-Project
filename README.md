## Modules of System
PetSet Animal Adoption System is an application that aims to find a loving home for homeless animals by bringing animal lovers Decoupling together. Our goal in developing the project is to make the animal adoption process more transparent, effective and sensitive, so that users can easily apply for adoption ads and adopt their own pets.
Users can select the type of animal they specify via the application (cat, dog, bird, etc.) they can easily access privately listed ownership postings. Our application allows users to see detailed information about the ads they are applying for. The system lists which cities the applicants come from. In addition, users can create their own adoption ads, so they can also help their own pets find a new home.
The system offers a user panel where users can update their personal information and track the ads they have applied for. In addition, it offers a wide experience to users by offering the possibility of purchasing various pet products through the shopping module. The aim of PetSet is to create a more conscious and responsible animal ownership culture in society by supporting animals to find a loving family.
